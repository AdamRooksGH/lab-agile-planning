# Agile-Planning Example
This repository demonstrates how to create a well-structured Kanban board using GitHub Projects, with clearly defined user stories ready for development in an Agile setting.
Each user story highlights the value of a task to a specific role (e.g., user, system administrator, service provider) and includes acceptance criteria written in the Gherkin format, (Given / When / Then) to ensure clarity and testability.
