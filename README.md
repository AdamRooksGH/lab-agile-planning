# agile-planning
This repository contains an example of how to make a well structured kanban board with well defined user stories.
I created a template to follow when adding new user stories to allow for more defined tasks and what each tasks value is to a specific person.
I defined each collum on the board aswell to describe its purpuse in order to better organise the user stories so that the project is ready for development
in a structured manner.
The issues in my kanban board are for an imaginary counter service.
